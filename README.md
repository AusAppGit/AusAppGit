- 👋 Hi, I’m @AusAppGit and welcome to some information about me
- 👀 I’m interested in a great many things, ranging from art, music, programming to extreme sports and thinking (the most extreme of sports!)
- 🌱 I’m currently (re)learning my way through some programming languages: Java, C#, Python, (and I'd like to spend more time with Kotlin)
- 👷‍♂️ I’m looking to collaborate on mostly creative projects, you can be quite free with the meaning
- 📫 How to reach me: through here preferably (I like to keep my web-presence to a minimum)
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- 🗣️ Languages: English (Native), German, Spanish
- 👨‍🎓 Education: Bachelor Electronic Arts from the University Western Sydney
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love to learn, doesn't really matter what because I find that any kind of knowledge tends to broaden one's experience and reference for future problem solving.
  Ok, that wasn't fun... (suggestions welcome)
- 🤔 Any questions?  Feel free to ask
